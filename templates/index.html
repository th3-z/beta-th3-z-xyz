                        I've built this website to stand as a compendium of my public works. Much of the
                        software projects I've written should be available or linked here. Any services that I run are
                        detailed.
                    </p><p>
                        I will (in-future) write articles on topics including: software development, OpenBSD, Linux,
                        and free software. However I still have a lot of work to do on this site before I intend on
                        publishing anything.

                        Most of my software is hosted on my <a href="https://github.com/th3-z">GitHub</a> account. I can
